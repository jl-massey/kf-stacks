# Kubeflow Stacks
This is a project to play around with custom Kubeflow images.  These are not supported and they could be deleted/removed at any time, so fork if you want to keep anything.  I clean out my repos periodically.

Images are either jupyter notebooks or minimal variants to use with pipelines.  My intent is to try docker-slim with some of the 'production' images to see how small/efficient I can make them.
